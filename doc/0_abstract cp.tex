Recently, a botnet based DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, called target link flooding attack, has been reported.
This attack cuts off specific links over the Internet and disconnects a specific region from other regions.
Detecting or mitigating the target link flooding attack is more difficult than legacy DDoS attack techniques, since attacking flows do not reach the target region. 
Although many countermeasures have been proposed, no schemes can detect before it occurs.
In this paper, we propose a target link flooding attack prevention scheme by monitoring the number of traceroute packets at routers, since we notice that an attacker must send a large number of traceroute packets to decide target links. 
%Moreover, by analyzing the characteristic of the target link flooding attack that the number of traceroute packets simultaneously increases in various regions over the network, we propose a detection scheme with multiple detection servers to eliminate false alarms caused by sudden increase of traceroute packets sent by legitimate users.
We show the effectiveness of our scheme by computer simulations.
