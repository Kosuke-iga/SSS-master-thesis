Detecting IoT malware robustly against evasive techniques is imperative.


As an IoT malware detection scheme, \we focus on the scheme leveraging binary-derived grayscale images for convolutional newral network in IoT device detection because it can cope with the accelerating IoT malware surge due to the automatic and light-weight analysis which CNN can realize.
However, that scheme can be evaded by the adversary with manipulated malware grayscale image or binary data.
In this paper, \we propose an evasion-resilient IoT malware detection scheme with invalidating adversarial byte sequences and 1D convolutional filters.
The valuable regions still remain which contribute to classification in both manipulated targets, grayscale image and binary data, after the attacks.
Thus, I improve the detection accuracy by statically extracting/enhancing valuable region of each manipulated target to the CNN model.
By evaluation with each manipulated dataset, \we show \our scheme can improve detection performance against both evasive techniques. 
Exploring the valuable regions remaining in manipulated target and improvement of the detection accuracy utilizing the regions in my detection are the contributions of my research.
